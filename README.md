# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews

### **Purpose of Project**

The purpose of this project is to perform **sentiment analysis** on restaurant reviews. With the exponential growth of online platforms, customers frequently share their dining experiences in the form of text reviews. These reviews contain valuable insights regarding customer satisfaction, preferences, and overall perception of restaurants. By analyzing sentiments—positive or negative—from these reviews, restaurants can improve their services, address weaknesses, and enhance customer experiences. This project aims to automate the process of understanding reviews using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It provides a structured way to classify reviews into categories, helping businesses gain actionable insights quickly.

### **Features**

1. **Sentiment Classification**: Analyzes whether a review expresses positive or negative sentiment.

2. **Preprocessing of Text Data**: Cleans and prepares textual data for model training.

3. **Machine Learning Model Implementation**: Uses a supervised learning algorithm to classify reviews.

4. **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates accuracy and other relevant metrics to measure model effectiveness.

5. **Scalability**: Can analyze large datasets of restaurant reviews with ease.

6. **Visualization**: (Optional) Graphical representation of sentiment distribution if included.

7. **Customizability**: Allows easy replacement of the model with more advanced algorithms for better accuracy.

   #### **Model Used**

   The project uses the **Naïve Bayes Classifier** (or a similar model, e.g., Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machine). Naïve Bayes is a popular algorithm for text classification tasks due to its simplicity, efficiency, and strong performance on smaller datasets.

   **Why Use Naïve Bayes?**

   1. **Efficiency**: It performs well on text classification tasks with minimal computational resources.
   2. **Interpretability**: Easy to understand and implement.
   3. **Performance**: Works well for text data, especially when combined with proper preprocessing.
